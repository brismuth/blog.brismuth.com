  content="There are many books recommended for software developers. There’s an entire Stack Overflow thread dedicated to this topic and many blog posts as well. I’ve recently read Designing Data Intensive Applications, The Design of Everyday Things, and Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug. I learned many useful, applicable things from each of those.
However, there is one book above all others that I feel that all developers should read. It isn’t about building software, it’s about building relationships."

      <p>There are many books recommended for software developers. There’s an entire Stack Overflow thread dedicated to this topic and many blog posts as well. I’ve recently read Designing Data Intensive Applications, The Design of Everyday Things, and Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug. I learned many useful, applicable things from each of those.</p>
<p>However, there is one book above all others that I feel that all developers should read. It isn’t about building software, it’s about building relationships. It’s the classic <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</em> Many people are turned off by the title, thinking that it’s about learning to manipulate others. That’s not at all what it’s about. It’s about putting others’ feelings and needs first and building real, lasting relationships.</p>
<p>Why is this useful for a software engineer? <strong>At the end of the day, whether you’re a backend engineer or a web developer, your ability to understand people matters.</strong> The code you write will be read by people. The applications you build will be used by people.</p>
