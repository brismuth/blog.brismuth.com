      <p>Where I work, each developer has their own virtual machine that is only available inside our corporate network. Each developer has all their code on their laptops, and it is shared with their VM using NFS. This works great while inside the office, but sometimes we need to work from home.</p>
<p>The way our VPN is currently configured, our laptops do not keep the same internal IP address as they have when they are physically on the office network. Because of that, NFS mounts won’t work. After spending some time looking into potential solutions, I came upon SSHFS.</p>
<h4 id="sshfs-whats-that">SSHFS? What’s that?</h4>
<p>SSHFS is a tool that allows you to mount folders and files from a remote host in user space using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace">FUSE</a>. There are two really nice benefits to using it.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can mount files from any machine that you can SSH into</li>
<li>Because it is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space">user space</a> you don’t have to have root access on the client machine in order to use it.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to solve the problem described above, we store the code remotely on the VM, and then mount it locally in order to edit it.</p>
<h4 id="is-it-fast">Is it fast?</h4>
<p>SSHFS has a lot of different options, and you can read about them in the man page. You can also find detailed benchmarks for a variety of options at <a href="http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Sharing-Data-with-SSHFS">http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Sharing-Data-with-SSHFS</a>. After reading that article and experimenting some on my own, I typically use the options kernel_cache,cache=yes,compression=no. With these options enabled, performance ends up being very comparable to NFS. It’s not nearly as fast as having the code locally, but in my experience it is plenty for software development.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h4>
<p><strong>Installation:</strong> If you are on OS X, I recommend using <a href="http://brew.sh/">brew</a>. There is also a package for it in apt-get if you are using Ubuntu. SSHFS has also been ported to Windows, but I won’t be covering that here.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got SSHFS installed, using it is pretty straightforward. Simply run it from your client machine as follows:
<code>sshfs -o kernel_cache,cache=yes,compression=no user@host:/path/to/remote/folder /path/to/local/folder</code></p>
<p>Hooray! You can now access /path/to/local/folder as if it were a local directory.</p>
<p>When you are finished with the mount, you can unmount it like so:
<code>umount /path/to/local/folder</code></p>
<p>If the unmount fails, make sure that no processes are currently using that directory, including text editors and terminals.</p>
<p>If you regularly use these mounts, it would probably make sense to add them as bash aliases so you can quickly and easily manage them. You can do that by adding the commands to your ~/.bash_profile like this:
<code>alias mountCode=&amp;#39;sshfs -o kernel_cache,cache=yes,compression=no user@host:/path/to/remote/folder /path/to/local/folder&amp;#39;   alias unmountCode=&amp;#39;umount /path/to/local/folder&amp;#39;</code></p>
<p>After starting a new terminal session, you will now be able to simply type mountCode or unmountCode to manage your SSHFS mount.</p>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>Although SSHFS works in more situations than NFS, it isn’t quite as user-friendly. There are a couple things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t add an entry to /etc/fstab to have it automatically mount on boot</li>
<li>You need to manually unmount before losing network access. If you forget to unmount, the mount will get into a bad state and you’ll need to reboot your local machine or kill your local ssh process before you can access the shared files again.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>SSHFS is nice because it is versatile. It works when no other network share will. But it can be inconvenient. If the situation allows for it, I would recommend using NFS instead, because of its ability to auto mount code on boot and because of its stability despite network connectivity changes.</p>
